                     Comprising 5 National Parks (Banff, Glacier, Jasper, Kootenay, and Yoho) this area should be near the top of any bucket list.

                  <p>
                     And if you visit in the summer you'll be presented with an ocean of color and a literal sea of wildflowers. This country is truly wild and beautiful and still remains pretty much untouched.

                     You'll need to be made of strong stuff, especially if you embark on the 4-mile hike up to Sunburst Peak. If you get a chance wander down to the lake itself to cool your feet down.

                     It is glacially fed and as a result, is crystal clear all year round. Breathe in a deep lungful of air that will be about the freshest you will get on the planet and admire sweeping and wild vistas.

                     The lake was actually man-made after the Saskatchewan river was dammed in 1972. If you'd visited in the 60's you'd have probably been stood in a grassy valley. But the human endeavor isn't actually the best bit about Lake Abraham.

                  <p>
                     The lake is beautiful all year round with milky blue glacial water. Here's our advice. Visit in winter, bring your camera. Due to deposits of various flora on the bed of the lake, huge methane gas bubbles are released. These are then trapped at various layers under the frozen surface.
